This is a large-scale simulation and management online game that primarily simulates real-world gameplay. It involves using computer hardware to participate in the game, and without the necessary hardware, players can only view the game world. The hardware can be ESP8266, ESP32, PC, or mobile devices. Within the game, there are numerous professions that players can create, and each profession allows for related work activities. Work is performed by supplying power to the devices, and going offline occurs when the power is disconnected. The game world runs automatically through backend logic, providing a highly realistic simulation of the entire world. Continuous logic updates are made to enhance the player experience. If you are interested, you can download the hardware client to participate in the game.
